                        Circa 1982, many consumers would have become accustomed to the steep and discouraging learning
                        curve of having a computer. At the time, Graphical User Interfaces didn't exist, as the majority
                        of all commercial and personal computers would have used CLI or Command Line Interface, which
                        many nowadays would contribute to the aesthetics of spy movies and hackers, as users would have
                        to learn several dozen lines of code to complete seemingly simple computational tasks. There was
                        no need for a mouse, as only typing was required, it was highly specific and any errors would
                        halt your progress drastically.
                        However, when personal and home computers became more mainstream, providers would have to modify
                        the setup of the computer to make it more user-friendly and to increase ease of access for the
                        public. <br>This is when UI was born.

                            The MacIntosh personal computer marked the new year, released on January 24th, setting a
                            precedent
                            for all technology that would follow. It was the first commercially successful personal
                            computer,
                            boasting both a mouse and graphical user interface, which had been employed by the previous
                            computer, the Xerox PARC Alto personal computer, which failed in the market despite the
                            newly
                            invented bitmap graphics. However, the success wouldn't have been granted if not for Susan
                            Kare,
                            who
                            had only been hired the year prior with no experience regarding computer graphics or
                            typefaces.
                            However, she did have a degree in fine arts and graphic design, and with a growing interest
                            in
                            technology, she couldn't refuse the offer.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                    </div>
                    <div class="appletxt2">
                        <p>One of the biggest challenges in designing the icons was the limitation of the screen
                            resolution
                            at
                            the time. The early Macintosh had a low screen resolution of 72 dpi or dots per inch, so
                            each
                            icon
                            had to be very simple, clean, and recognizable at small sizes around 32x32 pixels or 64x64
                            pixels.
                            Her background in art helped considerably with this as she compared the work to that of
                            mosaic
                            or
                            needlepoint, working on small precise scales, bit by bit. Kare used visual metaphors to
                            create
                            these
                            icons. For example, the trash can icon was designed to represent a place where discarded
                            files
                            went
                            just like a real trash can. This immediately conveyed the idea to users without needing any
                            explanation. Some symbols however were more thought out than others, such as the “cut” and
                            “boot”
                            icons, and the command icon “⌘” was inspired by the Sweedish symbol for “a point of
                            interest”,
                            as
                            she had seen the symbol on road signs while travelling. Even more interesting is that many
                            sources
                            say that the symbol means a place of power instead, which isn't far off, as Kare received
                            mail
                            from
                            someone stating that the loops are meant to represent the turrets on a castle, thus denoting
                            the
                            “power” or “command” aspect of the symbol. </p>

                        <p> Kare wanted the UI to make the concept of owning a
                            computer easy to digest for the average consumer, to make it less intimidating, which is
                            where
                            the
                            Happy Mac comes into place. The Happy Mac icon was designed by Kare to invite new users in
                            and
                            make
                            them feel more at ease by creating a cute design that took the edge off the intimidating
                            premise
                            of
                            computing. The icon itself is reminiscent of the Bauhaus logo, showing the expansive
                            knowledge
                            of art history that Kare had accumulated to use in her design arsenal. This is clearly shown
                            later down the line when the Happy Mac icon evolved into the app finder icon, which has the
                            same
                            split face the Bauhaus has combined with the classic smile and shape of many of Kare’s
                            original
                            concepts for design, such as her “danger” icon.

                        used
                        UI icons, symbols and displays, making technology more widely accessible to the public, made

                        designs that have lasted decades of use, and made computers “less cold and intimidating” with
                        fun,
                        quirky and whimsical designs that defy the stereotype of evil devices with ulterior motives such

                            while working at Microsoft, Kare designed one of the first digital solitaire games which was
                            a
                            method
                            for teaching new users how to use the mouse, a relatively new addition to computers at the
                            time,
                            with a
                            game that was well-known and simple enough that people would be able to learn the controls
                            of
                            the
                            mouse
                            without even knowing they’re learning.

                    <p>In addition, she made several icons for Windows that were
                        remanded in use from Windows 3.0 up until Windows XP. While still staying under the
                        Microsoft
                        umbrella,
                        she worked on a collaborative project with IMB, OS2, an alternative to DOS, in which she
                        designed
                        not
                        just the icons for the system, but colour dithering, a method which prevents colour banding,
                        which
                        is
                        commonly seen when images are compressed to a significantly smaller size, in which any
                        colour
                        gradients
                        are segmented, becoming noticeable and ruin the image quality, while dithering uses a noise
                        effect
                        to
                        create smoother gradients.

                    In 2015, Kare was hired by Pinterest, her first corporate and salaried job since she left Apple
                    thirty
                    years ago, and served as their lead product designer. She worked on the mobile and desktop “Brio”
                    rebrand, where she created several icons and revamped many of the older ones, such as the loading
                    cursor
                    being a rotating button in reference to the arts and crafts and DIY culture on the site. Kare's
                    portfolio of icons for this site is more rounded and bubbly, creating a more fun and cohesive style
                    for
                    the site. In an interview with John Brownlee from FastCompany, Kare compared the company with early
                    Apple, saying that the creative flow and team were so similar that it was comforting, that she was
                    so
                    pleased to see that the user-first experience that Apple was providing back in the 1980s hadn’t
                    died,
                    stating that the slogan for the Pinterest team was to “put pinners first”.

                The question of how Susan Kare became the mother of modern UI feels like it needs no answer. Kare has
                built a legacy with the most megalithic corporations creating their brand image, and the most
                recognisable parts of the brand that we as consumers would interact with almost daily, be it on our
                phones, tablets, laptops or otherwise, her influence is everywhere. The icons that she pioneered for the
                iOS system and Apple brand have stayed in effect until this day in some shape or form, with the designs
                either being adapted throughout the years or simply remaining as she created. She also sought not just
                to make accessible designs but to create welcoming ones, thinning the barrier between the public and
                computers, something that I believe is still relevant today, as technology becomes more advanced, many
                are expected to have a higher ad higher level of technical literacy, while many elderly and those
                unexposed to the digital world will more than likely struggle to adapt to the expectations of today's
                society, and in that regard, we should look back to Kares philosophy of making the digital world
                friendlier for all. Without Susan Kare's work, we would most likely be significantly behind
                technologically, not far out of the shadow of the command line interface and imputing all code manually
                to execute it, and that is the reason she is the mother of not just modern UI, but modern technology as
                a whole.
